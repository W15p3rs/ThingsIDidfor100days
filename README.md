# ThingsIDidfor100days


## What is the purpose of this repository?
### I need a sort of diary to track my progress and visually see the work that I do. Every day I will sign of on this repository, which will motivate me to work further.

## What skills am I interested in?
### I want to learn unreal engine 5 and coding in c++ to supplement it. I also want to learn cyber security to ensure safety of myself and also as a leverage in future career prospects.

## What will I use to achieve this goal?
### I will use roadmap.sh to plan a general path to my goal. I will take work on sites such as upwork and freelancer sites to make sure I get adequate proffesional practise.
